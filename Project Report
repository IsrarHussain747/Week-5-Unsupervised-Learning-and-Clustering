Project Report: K-Means Clustering and PCA on Synthetic Dataset

1. Introduction

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to analyze a synthetic dataset. The objectives include performing K-Means clustering, identifying the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method, and reducing dimensionality using PCA for better visualization.

2. Dataset Overview

The dataset used for this project is synthetic_dataset.csv, which contains two primary features:

Feature 1: Numeric attribute representing the first dimension of the dataset.

Feature 2: Numeric attribute representing the second dimension of the dataset.

3. Methodology

Step 1: Data Loading and Exploration

Imported required libraries: pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.cluster, and sklearn.decomposition.

Loaded the dataset using pd.read_csv().

Previewed the dataset using df.head() to understand its structure.

Step 2: K-Means Clustering

Selected the relevant features for clustering: Feature 1 and Feature 2.

Applied K-Means clustering with 3 clusters and a random_state of 42 for reproducibility.

Assigned the predicted cluster labels to a new column named Cluster in the DataFrame.

K-Means Clustering Visualization

Visualized the clustering results using a scatter plot.

Displayed cluster centroids in red (marked as 'X').

Findings:

Data points were grouped into 3 distinct clusters.

The centroids accurately represent the center of each cluster.

Step 3: Elbow Method for Optimal K

Calculated inertia (sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center) for K = 1 to 10.

Plotted the inertia values against the number of clusters to create an Elbow Plot.

Findings:

The Elbow Plot showed a significant bend around K = 3, confirming that 3 clusters is an optimal choice.

Step 4: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Applied PCA to reduce the dataset from 2 dimensions to 2 principal components.

Visualized the dataset in the PCA-transformed space using a scatter plot with clusters color-coded.

Findings:

PCA effectively preserved the structure of the dataset.

Clusters remained visually distinguishable after dimensionality reduction.

4. Results and Interpretation

K-Means Clustering: Successfully segmented the dataset into 3 meaningful clusters.

Optimal Cluster Identification: The Elbow Method confirmed K = 3 as the optimal number of clusters.

Dimensionality Reduction: PCA allowed effective visualization in a lower-dimensional space while maintaining clear cluster separation.

5. Conclusion

This project demonstrated the application of K-Means clustering and PCA for exploratory analysis of a synthetic dataset. The clustering successfully identified distinct groups, and PCA provided an intuitive visualization. These techniques can be extended to more complex datasets for enhanced insights
